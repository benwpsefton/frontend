    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      "These braised short ribs are pretty much foolproof. As long as two things
      happen, you are in for some very fine eats. First, the beef must be really
      well browned â€” I'm talking deep, dark, crusty, and caramelized. The other
      key step is easier. Just braise them until they're fork-tender. To
      paraphrase an expression, 'stick a fork in them, they're done.' After
      browning properly, the only way to mess these up is to undercook them, so
      don't."
